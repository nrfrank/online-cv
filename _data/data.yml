      - [STATS Edge](https://www.statsperform.com/team-performance/football/edge-analysis/):
      Refactor legacy data science pipeline and deploy existing scikit-learn models to Flask APIs. Contribute to Apache Spark ETL
      pipeline in a paired programming (XP) setting. [Optimize](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.13107.pdf) existing models, reducing runtime by an order of magnitude.
      - [NBA Live Win Probability](http://www.sloansportsconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2011.pdf):
      Achieved <b>SOTA accuracy (88%)</b> predicting end of game outcomes for NBA games given in-game context
      through the use of embedding techniques. Process and <b>release a curated dataset</b> containing 352 features of over 8.7M NBA plays from
      the 2002-03 through 2016-17 seasons. Present work at 2018 Sloan Sports Analytics Conference.
      - [STATS Insights](https://www.statsperform.com/media-and-tech/viewer-engagement/):
      Used LSI, LDA and other topic modeling techniques to classify <b>∼80k human generated media notes</b>, learning templates
      to automate nearly half (44% ). Delivered 546 automated notes using custom Jinja-based templates for Allstate’s March Mayhem campaign
